# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of all 
# available config options and their default values
# Additionally, each config option is also explained 
# in detail on Ghostty's website, at <https://ghostty.org/docs/config>
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect
